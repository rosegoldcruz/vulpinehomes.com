Service 1 — Cabinet Refacing (Our Specialty)

Cabinet refacing is the smartest upgrade for homeowners who like their layout but want a completely new look. Instead of tearing everything out, we replace doors and drawer fronts, apply a premium matching veneer to your existing cabinet frames, and upgrade hardware — delivering a like‑new kitchen in days, not months.

Why Arizona Homeowners Choose Refacing

Completed in 3–5 days

40–70% less than full replacement

No demolition dust or weeks without a kitchen

Soft‑close hinges and modern hardware standard

Finishes selected for Arizona heat, sun, and daily use

This is what we do best — fast, precise, and built to last.

Service 2 — Kitchen & Bath Remodeling (Through Trusted Partners)

Some projects require more than refacing. When walls move, layouts change, or bathrooms need full reconstruction, Vulpine coordinates the project through licensed remodeling partners — including Freedom Kitchen & Bath.

We stay in our lane and manage the process so homeowners don’t have to juggle contractors, timelines, and decisions. You get expert execution, clear communication, and a remodel that actually finishes on schedule.

Service 3 — Architectural Wall Panels & Interior Accents

For homeowners who want more character, we offer architectural wall panels and interior accent upgrades. These are design‑driven enhancements — not trends — used to add warmth, depth, and visual structure to living spaces.

From slat walls to full feature panels, installations are clean, precise, and finished quickly.

PAGE 3 — ABOUT VULPINE HOMES
Headline

Built to Do Things Better

Origin Story

Vulpine Homes was founded in 2025 after recognizing a pattern in the home remodeling industry: unnecessary delays, bloated costs, disconnected labor, and homeowners caught in the middle.

Instead of doing everything, Vulpine chose to do the right things exceptionally well.

By mastering cabinet refacing and building strong partnerships with licensed remodeling teams, we created a system that delivers high‑quality results faster, cleaner, and with far less friction — for homeowners, partners, and crews alike.

What We Believe

Efficiency is a form of respect

Specialization beats generalization

Great results come from great coordination

Homeowners deserve clarity, not confusion

Built for Arizona Homes

Arizona presents unique challenges — intense sun, heat, dust, and daily wear. Every material, finish, and process we use is selected with the Valley in mind. We bring samples into your home so decisions are made in real lighting, not a showroom guess.

The Vulpine Difference

We don’t chase trends or overload homeowners with options. We guide decisions, streamline execution, and stay accountable from first conversation to final install.

That’s how kitchen upgrades should work.
